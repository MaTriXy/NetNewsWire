# RSCore
Utility code for Mac and iOS apps.

The `main` branch builds a Mac framework and an iOS framework. The `spm` branch is a Swift Package.

Thereâ€™s a whole bunch of stuff in here. There are categories on Foundation and AppKit objects plus a few miscellaneous things.

(More notes will be coming.)
