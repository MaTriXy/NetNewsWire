    <td colspan="2"><p><em>Slanted Magazine #44—Type Fashion </em>explores the intersection of typography and fashion. Exploring the boundaries of conventional design and embracing cutting-edge typography as a dynamic canvas for fashion expression, this volume presents art pieces, conceptual works, unconventional positioning, bold messages, weird concepts, and off-road applications that challenge the status quo of fashion industries.</p>
<p>In addition to showcasing outstanding works, this issue features insightful essays by Christina Donoghue, Ann Marie Wainscott, Graphéine, Jelena Drobac, Ian Lynam, Jimmy Henderson, Kylièn Bergh, and Karmen Samson. Furthermore, interviews with Golnar Kat-Rahmani, Mirko Borsche, Jochen Smuda and Martin Fussenegger (Ucon Acrobatics), as well as Jean-Baptiste Levée, provide valuable insights into the intersection of typography and fashion. The issue concludes with an extensive appendix, listing all participating contributors.</p>
<p><em>Slanted</em> covers typography, graphic design and culture around the world. Begun as a weblog in 2004, the first printed edition of<em> Slanted</em> magazine was published in 2005, becoming the first German magazine devoted to typography.<br></p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>A fragile and powerful object, <em>UPO</em> 2 offers a singular reading experience, defined by serendipity and stark juxtaposition. Each copy is unique: approximately thirty photographs by Xenia Naselou (b. 1989) are randomly inserted over double-page spreads, where a dark, inky river flows—a graphic form designed by Rejane Dal Bello.</p>
<p>Printed on delicate, bible-like paper, the design is both magnetic and uncompromising, with sparse, fragmented texts in the margins that invite careful attention. Naselou’s photographs, born from her intimate observations of people and places, resonate deeply against the somber river, amplifying themes of displacement and human fragility.<br><br>As publisher Elodie Boyer notes, "instead of creating a graphic design to be an accompaniment to an artistic project, we set off on a search for photographs which would complement the magnetic and unwedded design of Rejane Dal Bello... Xenia was getting ready to go to the Greek island of Lesbos, to photograph refugees. We helped her modestly and together we created this UPO, a conjoining of serendipities."<br></p>
<p>The work within invites reader to touch the traces of human misery and handle them with care. </p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>The third installment of<em> Unidentified Paper Object</em> (UPO) explores Marion Bataille’s playful and profound approach to reading and writing. Published following <em>Writing One's Name</em>, her double exhibition in Le Havre (May–July 2018), this issue reflects on Bataille’s workshops, which offer alternative tools for literacy—an inventive second chance to complete the learning of reading and writing.<br></p>
<p>Through black, white, and red letters, the results of Bataille's workshops capture the beauty of effort: the recognizable forms shaped by clumsy, dignified gestures, daring creativity, and the inventiveness of learning. Observing these workshops, the editors sensed something significant taking place. To investigate further, <em>UPO</em> invited contributions from former schoolteacher Marie-Thérèse Zerbato Poudou, typography historian Sébastien Morlighem, philosopher Aude Lambert, and curator Lucile Haguet. <br></p>
<p>This issue includes an AOZ kit (scissors and glue not included) to encourage readers to engage in their own experiments—because nothing replaces the experience of making.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>The fourth issue of <em>Unidentified Paper Object</em>, "Reading the Sky" brings together the ethereal watercolors of Finnish artist Aino-Maija Metsola and stanzas written on site by Daniel de Roulet, delicately translated into English by Pierre Rusch.</p>
<p>Designed by Rejane Dal Bello—also responsible for the first three issues of <em>UPO</em>—this issue is shaped as a type specimen, where text, design, and art converge without borders.</p>
<p>In this issue, beauty emerges as a shared language and a quiet form of resistance. The works of the contributors are intertwined, dissolving distinctions for the sheer pleasure of their interplay. Paper itself becomes the final collaborator, its unique opacity and transparency revealing new dimensions of the book as an object.</p>
<p>"Reading the Sky" invites readers to discover a world where art and words coexist, layered in harmony.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;" data-mce-style="padding-left: 30px;"><span>"Built at the very end of the 19th century to study the physiology of the voice, Dr. Marage’s vowel machine sheds new light on the origins of sound measurement and the extensive field of writing the voice. Throughout the 20th century, the machine’s appearances in print were driven by a constant scientific curiosity for the mechanical reproduction of the voice along with an upheaval in affective relationships with machines. Coupled with the history of graphic inscription of the voice, it reveals a unique history of  our  attraction  and  repulsion  to  technical  objects.  Through its visual representations and mechanical and technological transfer, an “order of language” also emerges—a politics of language that continues to be exercised in contemporary forms of subjugation."</span><span></span></p>

This transformation of writing by machine and its emergence finds its roots in telegraphs and the advent of electricity in the 19th century. Mastery of this physical phenomenon converts our alphabet into new symbols drawn from electrical signals.<br><br>Our writings, initially addressed and interpreted by humans, are completed by a code that can be manipulated by the machine. Both of these worlds are intertwined so that a common code can exist. Each one uses the symbol that corresponds to it: the signal for machines and the sign for humans. This new code operates in the material dimension of the signals and is based on the presence or absence of an electrical current. This minimal activity establishes its form and, paradoxically, allows it to become completely detached from said form.<span>"</span></p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Much in our life at this moment is often marked by an absence of clarity. Many have experienced a malaise and come to know its persistence. We seem to have become used to stasis and theoretical discussions, lingering in silence and hoping from time to time for something extraordinary to happen. Yet it might also have been a blessing; an opportunity to free ourselves from overarching narratives, to direct our attention to the individual, the local, and to subjects that have long been part of our own lives—a more agile, intuitive mindset.</p>
<p>The third issue of <em>te </em>magazine took shape in this context, and chose to confront experiences of “plight” — the plight of the persecuted, of the artists, of the forgotten, and of those living with colonial legacies. How might we, as individuals, transmute plights in order to learn to live in this world?</p>
<p>If each piece in this issue can be said to propose a mode of healing, the aim is not only about specific pathologies, but also to recommend adjustments and defenses in moments of crisis. While writing on the plights of others, the authors also look inward for the roots of questions that they have long harbored about their own experiences. As introduced by Jacques Lacan, the theory of “the mirror stage” refers to children's initial awareness of their own existence. As adults, we continue to grapple with the process of self-discovery and understanding, at times feeling trapped deeply in the “mirror.”</p>
<p>This issue’s theme, Mirroring, represents a continuous exploration of the self. On the one hand, these pieces document the process of setbacks, negating, questioning and reconciling; others delineate the self by engaging with the other, a process discernible in several jointly-authored pieces in this issue, where a special connection and sense of fellowship form through dialogue, correspondence, and collaborative research.</p>
<p>In <em>Siddhartha</em>, Hermann Hesse described how the protagonist's worldview was shaped through seeking and struggle, and we hear in it an echo of the inspiration behind this issue of <em>te</em>: “But now, his liberated eyes stayed on this side, he saw and became aware of the visible, sought to be at home in this world, did not search for the true essence, did not aim at a world beyond.” </p>

Written and designed by teams of students at Boston University in Massachusetts, each issue presents essays, photo illustrations, creative writing, poetry and more that reflect on intersecting identities and experiences. The goal of the publication is to break down stereotypical depictions of Asian and Asian American experience, revealing complexities and diversity. <br><br>"POP!" (Issue 3) is a bubbly and saturated dive into the editorial and production team's identities as Asian students. Contents explore how participants "pop" out of restrictive norms and stereotypes and create their own narratives—ones that feel true and rich. Contributors color outside the lines and break through glass ceilings, find community and celebrate their unique journeys. From "Childhood" to "Adulting," this issue covers a range of life experiences.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Ben Tousley is a Brooklyn-based designer and art director whose work nimbly jumps from iconic record sleeves (for artists such as Grizzly Bear and Fleet Foxes) to magazine and editorial design (the fantastic Buds Digest) to fashion campaigns and on-screen graphics. He is a designer in the best sense of the word: his visual style varies from project to project—always hitting the mark in terms of feeling ideal for the project at hand—but upon closer inspection his personality shines through in elegant typographical moments or striking photographic manipulations.</p>
<p>For his contribution to the LAY—OUT series, Ben delivers an achingly idyllic set of images, a suite of enveloping nostalgia, culled from photographs taken on trips to Big Sur, Morocco, France, Denmark, Amsterdam and Portugal. Ben has filtered, combined and manipulated these photos and bits of found ephemera into a deeply personal -- yet absolutely universal—collection of images. Presented in three over-printed colors, the hazy Risograph reproduction only amplifies the sense of dreamy remembrance, the longing for the warmth of the past.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Noh Yung Hoon is a Korean American artist and illustrator currently based in the Bay Area. His intricate drawing work is rendered in extraordinarily detailed high contrast drawings, all done by hand. Alternately focused on more straightforward composition and hyper-detailed optical patterns, Noh's work feels like a universe unto itself; the cosmic ziggurats, personal computers, floating doors leading to unknown dimensions along with undulating background textures and fill patterns combine into a wholly unique set of images. The viewer's perception is inherently altered when taking in one of these compositions— the mass of black and white recedes into moments of clarity as moments of recognition bubble up from the chaos; bits of arcane symbols, alien faces, eyeballs, buildings and so much more seep into one's consciousness.</p>
<p>In this volume, Hoon's drawings distort our perceptions in a very psychedelic way, feeling like crisply rendered DMT visions or the luminous patterns and vortices that arise when one closes and rubs their eyes long enough.<br></p>

<p>Each issue organizes the work of twelve photographers around a specific topic present in popular periodical publications: sports, fashion, automobile, travel, beauty, animals, architecture, cinema, history, and so on.</p>
<p>This heterogeneous exploration of approaches to modern and contemporary photography is based on a simple principle: a composition in twelve 19 × 27 inch wall posters, each folded and detachable.<br><br>The magazine promotes a multifaceted view of photography practices. It showcases the work of iconic photographers and includes the latest generation of talents, becoming a platform for criticism, editing, curating, collecting, and decorating, allowing the readers to explore aesthetics beyond its canonization.<br><br>Never have images been so displayed, allowing them to fold out of their pages, and to take over our walls, striking our retinas with their powerful resolution. By profaning the widely accepted cross-fold printing norm, the readers reconnect with the origins of the genre: posters inserted in popular publications, about football or music, motorcycles or ponies, often intended for the youth, who would then make these figures their own totems.<br><br>Issue 01 includes 12 folded posters by 12 photographers: Julia Andréone, Area of Work, Roman Cieslewicz, Stig De Block, Thomas Demand, Marie Deteneuille, Aurélien Froment, Antonio Masotti, Simon Menner, Marie Quéau, Kuba Ryniewicz, Deborah Turbeville<br></p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Multihyphenation is a compound term referring to alternate modes of creative production: “Collab” culture; “brand X brand” projects; and multiple, or even opaque styles of attribution and ownership among the individuals, studios, and practices that engage in such work. For them, the “body of work” they produce matters more than maintaining a singular creative identity as an individual designer, architect, artist, and so on.</p>
<p>As Virgil Abloh—the consummate multihyphenate—remarked in an interview, “it’s explicitly the fact that I split my time among many things that gives me the point of view to know that what I’m doing is relevant.” Which is to say, one way of navigating a world dominated by multinational corporate firms and global brands is simply to become a multiplicity: architect-hyphen-curator-hyphen-art director-hyphen-furniture designer-hyphen-theorist-hyphen-fashion designer, etc., etc., ad infinitum.<br data-mce-fragment="1"></p>
<p>The 51st issue of <em>Harvard Design Magazine</em>, “Multihyphenate,” is edited by Sean Canty, Assistant Professor of Architecture, and John May, Associate Professor of Architecture, both from the Harvard Graduate School of Design, and Zeina Koreitem, design faculty at the Southern California Institute of Architecture (Sci-Arc).</p>
<p>The guest editors have invited an international group of architects, curators, fashion designers, scholars, and artists to question the issue’s theme from different vantagepoints.</p>
<p>Is multihyphenation actually new? SUPERSTUDIO, Rem Koolhaas, Denise Scott Brown, the Eameses, Eileen Gray, even Le Corbusier (the list is endless)—weren’t they all, in some way or another, multihyphenates? Or is something different happening today?</p>
<p>Is multihyphenation a legitimate political response to present conditions, or must it always devolve into a cynical branding strategy? And crucially, is this model of practice allowing marginalized voices in the design fields to have more presence? Were there multihyphenates in the past who were overlooked in their own time, precisely for their marginal status?</p>
<p>The issue features curator Antwaun Sargent in conversation with artists Rick Lowe and Amanda Williams, as well as interviews by the guest editors with fashion designer Casey Cadwallader of Mugler, artist Farah Al Qasimi, and Felix Burrichter, founder and creative director of PIN–UP magazine.</p>
<p>An essay by artist Irena Haiduk on the Third Way and Yugoslav fashion designer Aleksandar Joksimović is accompanied by never before published drawings by the designer. Architect Andrew Witt and artist collective Metahaven consider the future of artificial intelligence in design in a pair of essays.</p>
<p>The issue also includes a lecture by the artist, designer, and landscape architect Barbara Stauffacher Solomon, given at the Harvard Graduate School of Design in 1986, as well as other contributions by Jasmine Benyamin, Esther M. Choi, Jean-Pascal Flavien, Carolyn L. Kane, Mark Lee, Malkit Shoshan, Oana Stănescu, and Alfredo Thiermann.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p><em><span style="color: #000000;">Slanted Magazine #42—Books</span></em><span style="color: #000000;"> is a magazine about books. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Every day, people ponder whether the future of the (printed) book is tied to its sensual quality. How can beautiful books secure their place in the media and society? How are content, medium, and form interconnected? Is manufacturing and design quality, in addition to its functionality, simply to be understood as a marketing argument?</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="color: #000000;">In this edition, Slanted delves deeper into books that are pushing boundaries, moving beyond traditional norms, and rediscovering their essence. The belief is that genuine reading encompasses more than mere skimming; it involves understanding, grasping, and engaging in creative thinking. The value placed on the tactile experience of holding a book, flipping through its pages, setting it aside, and seamlessly resuming the reading is immense. It's an experience cherished by many, one that defines the true essence of books.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Slanted emphasizes the resurgence of book reading as a significant trend, especially for those seeking enduring experiences and embracing multi-dimensional thinking. This edition showcases books that venture off the beaten path, departing from traditional conventions, juxtaposing these works (which celebrates accidents, build on mistakes and inaccuracy, and draw on experimental procedures, from processing to AI-generated content) against examples of timeless book designs where the content shapes the form.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Softcover, 256 pages, color and b&amp;w images, 6.3 × 9.45 inches</span></p>
